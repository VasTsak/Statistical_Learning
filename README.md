# Statistical Learning

It is an area of statistics combined with machine learning. It is a recently developed method of understanding complex data sets.

Let's assume that we want to predict $Y$ based on $X$. We assume that there is a function $f(X)$ that approximates $Y$.

$$Y = f(X) + \epsilon$$
Where $\epsilon$ is a random *error term*.

Statistical Learning, is a set of methods that approximate this $f$ function. This $f$ function can be used for **prediction** or **inference**. In the former case, we want to predict the dependent variable ($Y$) using a set of independent variables ($X$). In the latter case, we want to see the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable (association of $X$ with $Y$, relationship $Y$ with $X$)

Statistical Learning can be divided into **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning** tools. 

But what is the difference between **Statistical Learning** and **Machine Learning**?
