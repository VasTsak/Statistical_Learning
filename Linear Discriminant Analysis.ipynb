    "**Linear Discriminant Analysis** is a very good alternative of Logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, It is a less direct approach of predicting the target. It models the distribution of predictors for every Y ($P(X|Y)$ and then it uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the $P(Y|X)$. When we assume that the distributions of $P(X|Y)$ are normal, the model is very similar to logistic regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when do we prefer LDA over Logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the classes are well-separated Logistic regression tends to be quite unstable, LDA not so much.\n",
    "* When the number of observations is small and the distribution of X for every class is normal, LDA tends to be more stable\n",
    "* LDA is preferred more when we have a multi-class problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayes theorem formula is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y = k |X = x) = \\dfrac{P(X = x|Y = k)P(Y = k)}{P(X = x)} $$\n",
    "$$P(Y = k |X = x) = \\dfrac{P(X = x|Y = k)P(Y = k)}{\\sum_{l = 1}^{classes} P(X = x | Y = l)P(Y = l)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $P(X = x)$ is the prior probability that a random observation comes from class k.\n",
    "* $P(X = x|Y = k)$ is the density function of X for an observation that comes from the $k^{th}$ class\n",
    "* $P(Y = k |X = x)$ is the posterior probability that an observation x belongs to class k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another application for LDA is \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, LDA is a classifier that approximates Bayes classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets really mathy, and I will not go through it. In case you are interested into the math(it is totally recommended to check it out) go for two classes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis#LDA_for_two_classes) and for a multi-class model [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis#Multiclass_LDA)\n",
    "But in sort, \n",
    "\n",
    "LDA approaches the problem by assuming that the conditional probability density functions p(x|y=1) and p(x|y=2) are both normally distributed with mean and covariance parameters (μ1,Σ1) and (μ2,Σ2)\n",
    "\n",
    ", respectively. Under this assumption, the Bayes optimal solution is to predict points as being from the second class if the log of the likelihood ratios is below some threshold T, so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(x - \\mu_{1})^{T} - \\Sigma^{-1}(x - \\mu_{1}) + ln|\\Sigma_{1}| - (x - \\mu_{2})^{T}\\Sigma_{2}^{-1}(x-\\mu_{2}) - lm|\\Sigma_{2}|<T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without any further assumptions, the resulting classifier is referred to as QDA (quadratic discriminant analysis). When $\\Sigma_1=\\Sigma_2=\\Sigma$ (homoscedasticity assumption) the discriminant functions it is:\n",
    "$$(x - \\mu_{1})^{T} - \\Sigma^{-1}(x - \\mu_{1}) - (x - \\mu_{2})^{T}\\Sigma_{2}^{-1}(x-\\mu_{2})<T$$"
